# Vehicle Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning to cluster vehicles into groups based on features such as weight, engine size, and horsepower. The goal is to help an automotive company better understand patterns in their vehicle data by identifying natural groupings without using predefined labels.

## Overview

Unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, are used to analyze and visualize relationships among vehicles. By grouping similar vehicles, the company can gain insights into their product lineup and customer preferences.

---

## Features

- Clusters vehicles based on quantitative features (weight, engine size, horsepower, etc.)
- Visualizes clusters using scatter plots
- Uses synthetic or real automotive data
- Helps interpret similarities and differences among vehicle groups

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ennin-Rashid/Vehicle-Clustering-.git
   cd Vehicle-Clustering-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Or, if using Jupyter:*
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook file (typically `vehicle_clustering.ipynb`).

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load or generate vehicle data
   - Perform clustering (e.g., using KMeans)
   - Visualize the clustered groups

---

## Results

- **Cluster Visualization:**  
  Scatter plots will display how vehicles are grouped based on features such as weight and horsepower. Each cluster will be represented by a different color.
- **Insights:**  
  The visualizations help reveal natural groupings, such as sports cars, SUVs, or compact vehicles, based on their specifications.

## Interpreting Clusters

Since this is unsupervised learning, there are no "correct" labels. Instead, clusters are interpreted based on feature similarities. For example, you may observe:
- Lightweight, low horsepower vehicles grouped together
- Heavy, high engine size vehicles forming another cluster

These insights can guide further product development and marketing strategies.
